Frame.java:
Added Hitboxes to every aircraft in the game.
After each Hitbox, there are sop (System.out.println) functions to confirm hitbox moves with its assigned Aircraft.
Similar sop functions exist for each Hitbox update by the method resetBounds().

Drone.java:
Added descriptions for KeyEvents.
Added => import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;

Hitbox.java:
Commented out all code using Java Swing.
Added methods to retrieve bounds.
Added method to print bounds to String.
Moved setting bounds into a private method setBounds().
Each time Aircraft moves, the method resetBounds() calls setBounds() to update Aircraft's collision bounds.

Scoreboard2.java:
Uses int to count wins, losses, and total games.
Clarified some explanations.
