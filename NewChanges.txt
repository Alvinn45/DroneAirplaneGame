Frame.java:
Added Hitboxes to every aircraft in the game.
After each Hitbox, there are sop (System.out.println) functions to confirm hitbox moves with its assigned Aircraft.
Similar sop functions exist for each Hitbox update by the method resetBounds().

Added "tags" to index the primary purpose for the written methods:
Master - GUI
Drone - Player controlled aircraft
Plane - Enemy aircrafts
Game - Game environment

Drone.java:
Added descriptions for KeyEvents.
Added => import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;
Drone initializes number of lives from Scoreboard2's variable for available lives.

Hitbox.java:
Commented out all code using Java Swing.
Added methods to retrieve bounds.
Added method to print bounds to String.
Moved setting bounds into a private method setBounds().
Each time Aircraft moves, the method resetBounds() calls setBounds() to update Aircraft's collision bounds.

Scoreboard2.java:
Uses int to count wins, losses, and total games.
Clarified some explanations.
Includes final variables that set the parameters for the game (Available lives, Game timer, minimum lives for win).
